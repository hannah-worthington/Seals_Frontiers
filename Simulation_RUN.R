# simulation study to look at two aspects
# 1. Single cohort versus multiple cohort estimation on recruitment and the effect of sample size (especially small samples)
# 2. Ability of AIC to choose the correct distribution on the recruitment distribution

### Simulation study 1

# simulate data
# fit model for each cohort separetly and collectively
# plot the recruitment distribution side-by-side for each cohort



### Simulation study 2

# simulate data, repeat for each distribution considered (Poisson, normal, log-normal)
# fit multiple cohort model assuming different distributions
# proportion where the correct model is chosen by AIC
